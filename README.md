# go-gin-tigris
Go web server app using gin framework and connect to tigris, run live mod using air

# How can you run this prj? 
## Ok, let's go

### 1. Install go > 1.18 
    Make sure that you will not set GOROOT and GO1111MODULE env is not "on"

### 2. Install gin (https://gin-gonic.com/docs/quickstart/)
### 3. Install air
    Using for live reload when you guy make some change in your go app, server will automatically refresh 
    https://github.com/cosmtrek/air ===> Amazing feature

### 4. Install swaggo for gin (that is swagger haha)
    Here you are: https://github.com/swaggo/gin-swagger


I think i did not talk about tigris but that just a serverless db, you can replace it with another which dependent on ur config. Gook luck
